# Origin of signature matrices

## V2
The signature matrix has been downloaded from [Cosmic](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2). The matrix of attribution of active signatures to cancer types has been adapted from the [Tracksig package](https://github.com/morrislab/TrackSig/blob/master/annotation/active_signatures_transposed.txt) (as of commit 1644776b6f88d58ff24e6bbb6ca8b65bf59e7779).

## V3
The signatures have been downloaded from [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn12009743). There are two files, one for whole exome (syn11967914), and the other for whole genome (syn11738319). The matching of signatures to cancer types was adopted from file "signatures_in_samples_and_cancer_types.mat" in the source of SigProfiler package downloaded from MathWorks (Version: 2.5.1.7)
